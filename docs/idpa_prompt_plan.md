## Step 1: Project Foundation & Authentication
**Goal:** Set up Next.js 14 with Convex, basic auth, and user roles

### Prompt 1.1: Manual Project Setup
**Goal:** Create the Next.js project using official command, then set up custom structure

#### Step 1.1a: Create Next.js App
Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest idpa-tournament-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

When prompted, select:
- ✅ TypeScript
- ✅ ESLint  
- ✅ Tailwind CSS
- ✅ `src/` directory
- ✅ App Router
- ✅ Import alias (@/*)
- ❌ Turbopack (not needed for this project)

Then navigate to the project:
```bash
cd idpa-tournament-app
```

#### Step 1.1b: Create Custom Folder Structure
Add the IDPA-specific folder structure from PRD section 6.4.1:

```bash
# Create the folder structure from PRD section 6.4.1
mkdir -p src/app/\(auth\)
mkdir -p src/app/\(dashboard\)
mkdir -p src/components/features/{scoring,tournaments,squads,badges}
mkdir -p src/components/layouts
mkdir -p src/lib/{convex,hooks}
mkdir -p src/types
mkdir -p convex

# Create initial files
touch src/components/ui/.gitkeep
touch src/types/index.ts
touch convex/schema.ts
touch convex/_generated/.gitkeep

# Create environment files
touch .env.example
```

#### Step 1.1c: Install Additional Dependencies
Add the IDPA-specific dependencies:

```bash
npm install convex clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react class-variance-authority @radix-ui/react-slot concurrently
```

#### Step 1.1d: Update package.json Scripts
Update the scripts in `package.json` to include Convex:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run convex:dev\" \"next dev\"",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "convex:dev": "convex dev",
    "convex:deploy": "convex deploy"
  }
}
```

#### Step 1.1e: Create Environment Example
Create `.env.example`:
```
# Convex
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=

# Social Auth (for later)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=
```

#### Step 1.1f: Update .gitignore
Add Convex-specific entries to `.gitignore`:
```
# Convex
.convex/
```

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Start with Prompt 1.1** and complete each step fully before moving to the next
2. **Test thoroughly** at each step - don't proceed if current step isn't working
3. **Keep the PRD handy** for reference on specific requirements
4. **Focus on IDPA compliance** - the scoring system must be exactly correct
5. **Mobile-first approach** - test on mobile devices throughout development
6. **Use the specified tech stack** - don't substitute technologies
7. **Build incrementally** - each step should add value and be demonstrable

This plan will result in a complete, production-ready IDPA Tournament Management System that meets all requirements specified in the PRD.
